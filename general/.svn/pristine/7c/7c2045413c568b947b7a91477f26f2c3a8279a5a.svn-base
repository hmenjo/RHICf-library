                             LHCf Library 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Requriement 
    - ROOT library. 
      The LHCf library may work with ROOT 6.XX. 
      But better to use ROOT 5.34.36. (The newest version of 5.34.XX)    

- Installation and Compile  
   - Get the newest version of the library's codes 
     svn co svn+ssh://lhcf@lhcfs1.isee.nagoya-u.ac.jp/extern/crhome/lhcf/repos/LHCf/Analysis/LHC/general/trunk ./general
   - Complie in the library's directory 
     make clean;  
     make 
    
   Note) 
     - One compile option, choice of the SlowControl Format, is available in Makefile. 
     - sc/SocketControl does not work under c++11 (gcc > 4.7). 

- Useful tools 
   - Tools/LHCfroot 
       It works as the interpleter mode of root. 
       The LHCf library is loaded automatically. So LHCf classess can be used in macros.
   - Tools/EventViewer
       EventViewer for LHCf/RHICf data. 
       For compiling it, please specify the format as make op2015, make rhicf    
       
- Operational tests 
   + Linux
        - Scientific linux CERN 5.8 + gcc 4.1.2 + ROOT 5.34.32
        - Scientific linux CERN 6.7 + gcc 4.4.7 + ROOT 5.34.25
   + Mac 
        - OS X 10.11 + clang + ROOT(root_v5.34.36.macosx64-10.11-clang70)
          At least, ROOT 5.34.00 did not work. Better to use the newest ROOT 5.

- Updates 
   May 2, 2017 (Rev 2435)
   +  Many modifications to use the library with MacOS. 
      Mainly in Makefile, static const doulbe in header files, and SocketControl.    
   +  Added many tables and config files for the RHICf operation.  
          GainTable_Fit_20170427.txt, MAPMTgaintable_20170501.txt   
          hvtable_rhicf2017_normal.txt, hvtable_rhicf2017_high.txt
